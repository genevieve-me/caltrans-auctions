\section{Conclusion}

We were able to obtain estimates of the distribution of values for bidders
on CalTrans procurement projects using data on their bids and estimates of
the true cost. This is because there is an optimal bidding function which we
assume the bidders followed. The work was complicated by the existence of
small- and large-business type bidders.
