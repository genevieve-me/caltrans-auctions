\subsection{Institutional Details}

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is the department that
manages Aeronautics, Highway Transportation, Mass Transportation,
Transportation Planning, Administration, and the Equipment Service Center in
California. To outsource the labor for their highway construction projects,
Caltrans runs low-bid procurement auctions. Within the auctions, there are
typically large and small business bidders. Because small businesses have lower
economies of scale, their costs are higher compared to large businesses.

Due to the difference in costs, Caltrans grants ``bid preferences'' to the small
business bidders. Small businesses must meet three qualifications to be obtain
the Small Business Certification. The certification requires that the business
must be independently owned and operated in California, have no more than 100
employees, and over the last three tax years can only earn under \$10 million
average annual gross receipts. The benefit of the Small Business Certification
is that there is a higher probability of winning the auction.

Once all bids are submitted, the lowest bid wins the auction. However, if a
small business’s bid is within 5\% of the lowest bid, they win the auction and
are awarded the contract for construction. While the 5\% discount is used to
determine the winner, it is not applied to the actual amount the business is
paid for the project: Caltrans will pay the true price the winner bid.

\subsection{Data Overview}

\input{sections/data-summary.tex}

One immediate takeaway from the summary statistics is that small businesses are often
refusing to bid on larger contracts, given that their bids are both
much smaller on average and have a smaller standard deviation.

In addition, out of 705 auctions in total, there were 5.7 bidders in
each auction on average, and the average bid was \$968,241.65.

We calculated the winning bids and saw that on average, the winning bid was
\$39,417 lower than the state's cost estimate. This is a relatively small
difference, but it does suggest that competition among the bidders does drive
the procurement cost down for the state. It could also potentially
represent a winner's curse if the cost estimates are very accurate,
but this would require more analysis to confirm.
Furthermore, the standard deviation of the differences is quite high
at almost \$1 million, and there are some cases where Caltrans
is forced to pay a premium over their estimate - it is unclear if this
represents unreliability by the engineers making the estimates,
or an underlying dynamic of the auction process.

\subsubsection{Kernel Density Estimation}

First we estimated the true distribution of bids for large and
small businesses using kernel density estimation with a bandwidth
selected via leave-one-out cross-validation.
Kernel density estimation relies on the second derivative of the
density function, and will as a result tend to overestimate peaks and
underestimate valleys. We can see that in this plot, where
the density estimate is much higher than the first peak.

%\end{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{imgs/lb-pdf.png}

The large business bids do have a longer tail, which reflects that
they are more able to take on projects with a large cost than
the smaller businesses.
There are also clusters in the bid frequencies, which we can see in
the spikes in the KDEs of the PDFs. It makes sense that the distribution
of bids is not perfectly uniform, but instead clusters because projects
can be grouped into similar size categories, and because people generally prefer
to deal with round numbers when it comes to money.
Many more projects will receive bids at \$1 million than at
\$1,010,000.

Because of the data's skew, we applied a log transformation to
normalize the data. Log scaling data can effectively compress
very wide ranges down, so that extreme bids are proportionally less
large. Consequently, the goal of this transformation was to
provide a better visualization of the long tail in our data.

This reveals a very slight bimodal peak around bids of about \$3 million
$(\exp(15))$, which might be a common project cost.
The larger businesses look to have a very similar distribution, but just have
a higher mean, and their tail also extends further up to bids of around \$7-8
million.

\medskip
We also plotted the CDFs to see patterns in the bid sizes between
the two types of bidders. The smaller average bids of
the small businesses are very clear in this plot, as the line is strictly
greater than the large businesses' estimated CDF.

\subsubsection{Regressions}

To better understand the bidding behavior of business, we ran regressions on
bidders, engineer’s estimate, and work days. Bidders is how many bidders there
were for a certain project, engineer’s estimate is the estimate on how much a
professional believes the project costs, and work days is how long the project
will take. The first regression we ran included both small and large
businesses, and below is the result.

\input{sections/data-regressions.tex}

The above table shows the output of three regressions of the
number of bidders, estimated cost, and workdays spent on the job,
on the procurement bids. The first covers all of the data,
the second only certified small businesses, and the third large businesses.
The results of this regression are as we expected. The negative sign on bidders
is consistent with the theory we studied, because with more bidders in a
particular auction, it drives down the price of the bid.
Similarly, as the engineer’s estimate increases, the bid should
increase because there is a higher cost for the project; and as work days
increase, so should the bid because projects that take longer become more expensive.

%\[
%\text{Bid} = -18,820 \text{Bidders} + 0.849 \text{Engineer’s Estimate} +
%716 \text{Work Days} + 224,200

%\text{Bid} = -16,470 \text{Bidders} + 0.9496 \text{Engineer’s Estimate} +
%154.3 \text{Work Days} + 135,200
%\]

The results for small businesses also have the same signs as we expected, for
the same reasons as above. The only difference in this regression is the degree
to which work days
influences the bid. The coefficient for the regression with only small business
bidders is 154.3 compared with 716 for the regression including all businesses.
This might indicate that number of work days does not increase the bid as much
because smaller businesses might not be able to handle the cost of larger
projects that require more time and capital. Therefore, they can’t bid as high.

%The next regression includes the same variables again, except it only focuses
%on large business bidders.

%\[
%\text{Bid} = -22250 \text{Bidders} + 0.8398 \text{Engineer’s Estimate} +
%1372 \text{Work Days} + 183900
%\]

A notable difference in the final regression, which is limited
to businesses that tend to be larger, is the greater coefficient
for work days, such that there is
a much larger coefficient on work days for large business bidders. This can be
explained by the fact that large businesses can handle the higher costs of
lengthier projects. Their economies of scale allow for them to afford projects
that require more time and capital. Because of this, they are more likely
to pursue such projects and can bid higher for them.
